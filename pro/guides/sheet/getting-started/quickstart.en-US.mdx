## Creating from a Template

Most of Univer Pro's functionalities depend on the server-side, so the first step is to deploy the server. We recommend deploying quickly using Docker with the following steps:

After download [license.zip](https://univer.ai/pro/license), under same folder run
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dream-num/helm-charts/main/install.sh)"
```

Once the server is up, you can create a new Univer Pro front-end application from a template using the commands below.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab label="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm dlx degit dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit [your-app-name]
    cd [your-app-name] && pnpm install # pnpm version >= 8
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab label="npm">
    ```shell
    npx degit dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit [your-app-name]
    cd [your-app-name] && npm install # npm version >= 7
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
