### Writing

We use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write documents. MDX is a markdown format that allows you to use JSX components.

### Graphs

Graphs help users to understand your ideas better. To keep styles of graphs consistent, we use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to create graphs. We store the source files of graphs in this repo directly. It is recommend to install [Excalidraw VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and use it to edit the source files.
