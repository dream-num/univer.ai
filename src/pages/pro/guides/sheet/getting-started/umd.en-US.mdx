## UMD

For reasons of maintainability and performance, Univer Pro does not offer UMD builds.

We encourage migrating your project to a build tool that supports ES Modules, such as Vite, esbuild, or Webpack.

If you're unable to migrate to a build tool that supports ES Modules, please reach out to us, and we'll do our best to support you.
