# Introduction to Univer Pro Sheet

Univer Pro is a plug-and-play solution designed for a series of complex business needs. It adopts the interfaces, components, and event mechanisms publicly available in the Univer open-source version and carefully encapsulates them.

Before you learn more about Univer Pro, we hope you understand:

The difference between Univer Pro and the Univer open-source version is that Univer Pro focuses on solving complex business needs, while the Univer open-source version focuses on providing basic functions.

If your business scenario is relatively simple, or Univer Pro cannot meet your special business needs, you can try to use the Univer open-source version with our [extension documentation](/guides/sheet/customization/canvas) to customize and develop the capabilities you need.

If Univer Pro happens to meet your needs, you can contact our team to get the official version of Univer Pro.

## 🎮 Online Demo

Just like the Univer open-source version, we also provide an online demo for Univer Pro. You can [🎮 click here](/pro/examples) to view the online demo of Univer Pro.

## 🎁 Compare Community Edition and Enterprises Edition

Univer Pro is divided into the Community Edition and the Enterprises Edition. We provide users with a 30-day free trial of the Enterprises Edition so that you can experience the full functionality of Univer Pro. The Enterprises Edition will automatically downgrade to the Community Edition after the trial period expires, and you can choose whether to purchase the Enterprises Edition before the trial period ends.
