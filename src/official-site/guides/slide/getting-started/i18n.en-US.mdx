# Internationalization

From version 0.1.13, Univer no longer includes any language packs, all language packs are provided by plugins. If you find it too cumbersome to manually import the language packs required by the plugin, we also provide a build tool plugin that automatically imports the language packs required by the plugin. Please refer to [Using Univer Plugins](/guides/doc/advanced/univer-plugins) for more information.

If you need to manually add language packs, you can refer to the following example, import the corresponding language pack as needed and assemble it into an object to pass it to the `Univer` instance:

```typescript
import { LocaleType, Tools } from '@univerjs/core';
import DesignEnUS from '@univerjs/design/locale/en-US';
import SlidesUIEnUS from '@univerjs/slides-ui/locale/en-US';
import UIEnUS from '@univerjs/ui/locale/en-US';

const univer = new Univer({
  theme: defaultTheme,
  locale: LocaleType.EN_US,
  locales: {
    [LocaleType.EN_US]: Tools.deepMerge(
      DesignEnUS,
      SlidesUIEnUS,
      UIEnUS,
    ),
  },
});
```

Univer currently supports the following languages:

- zh-CN: Simplified Chinese
- en-US: English
- ru-RU: Russian

You need to pay attention to the fact that since Webpack 4 does not support the `exports` field of package.json, you may need to modify the path to import the language pack.

```diff
- import DesignZhCN from '@univerjs/design/locale/zh-CN';
+ import DesignZhCN from '@univerjs/design/lib/locale/zh-CN.json'
```

If you are using TypeScript, you also need to confirm whether the `resolveJsonModule` option is configured in tsconfig.json.

```diff
{
  "compilerOptions": {
+    "resolveJsonModule": true
  }
}
```
