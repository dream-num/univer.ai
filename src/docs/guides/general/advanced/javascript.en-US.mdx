# Extending Univer in JavaScript

<BadgeGroup values={[UniverTypes.GENERAL]} value={UniverTypes.GENERAL} />

{/* To facilitate development, Univer uses a large number of [TypeScript decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) to declare dependency injection relationships.

Therefore, we certainly recommend that you use TypeScript first. However, if you are not familiar with TypeScript or are constrained by other reasons, you can also use JavaScript to extend Univer. Of course, this is not an easy task, as you may need to understand the internal mechanism of Univer and how to use JavaScript to implement decorators in TypeScript. */}
