# Deploying with Docker

<BadgeGroup values={[UniverTypes.GENERAL]} value={UniverTypes.GENERAL} />

Get up and running quickly with our Docker deployment solution for the Univer service, using Docker Compose for a hassle-free setup.

## System Requirements

1. CPU: Single core
2. RAM: 2GB
3. Storage: 10GB

Ensure you have [Docker version 23 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Technical Stack

Our architecture is built on PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.

## Quick start

Compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows/WSL environments.

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://get.univer.ai)"
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  If you encounter any issues during installation or use, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
</Callout>

Confirm that the document service has successfully started.

Access http://localhost:3010 in your web browser to create a new blank document, which will then redirect you to the document link (Internet Explorer is not supported).

Also, verify the successful startup of the collaboration service.

For a comprehensive test, try accessing it in various browsers or in private browsing mode to experience the full collaborative capabilities.

## Service introduction

<Image src={serviceImg} alt="service" />

- collaboration-server: collaboration engine server, use OT algorithm to deal edit conflic.
- lb: nginx loadbalance component.
- universer: univer backend api server, apply http api function for sheet, document, slide.
- univer-minio: S3 component, use to storage file content.
- univer-postgres: database component.
- univer-rabbitmq: MQ component, use in collaboration edit situation.
- univer-redis: cache component.
- univer-temporal: workflow component, use in import/export situation.
- univer-worker-exchange: import/export function component.

## Port Check

Ensure that the specified ports are not in use; if they are, terminate the conflicting processes before attempting to start again.

Default ports for Univer services are listed below:

| service Name | Port Number |  	Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| universer | 8000 | Serves API over HTTP |
| univer-minio | 19000 | Acts as the S3 storage server |
| univer-client | 3010 | Provides the frontend interface |

## Offline Deployment

If you need to deploy in an offline environment, we also provide an offline installation package. However, we recommend using the one-click installation script in a networked environment for easier updates.

<Steps>
  ### Download the offline installation package

  [Click here to download the offline installation package](https://univer.ai/releases/univer-server/download) and extract it on your server.

  ```bash
  tar -xvf installation-package.tar.gz # Replace 'installation-package' with the actual file name
  ```

  ### Start the service
 
  Navigate to the extracted directory and run `bash install.sh` to start the service.

  ### Verify that the service is available.

  **Method 1:** Start the built-in demo application and visit `http://localhost:3010` to see the results.

  ```bash
  docker run --net=univer-prod --rm --name univer-collaboration-lite -p 3010:3010 univer-acr-registry.cn-shenzhen.cr.aliyuncs.com/release/univer-collaboration-lite:latest
  ```

  **Method 2:** Set up your own front-end project. [Learn more](/guides/sheet/getting-started/quickstart#install-and-run-the-frontend).
</Steps>

### How to uninstall

```bash
bash uninstall.sh       # Uninstall while retaining data for future use
bash uninstall.sh clean # Uninstall and delete data
```

## Troubleshooting <a id="troubleshooting" />

### Where is the service dir?

In `docker-compose` dir, include `.env` config file, `run.sh` script.

### Having trouble starting on a Windows OS?

The `run.sh` script operates in a `bash` environment. To get it up and running, you'll need to use either Git Bash/MinGW or a WSL environment.

### Import/Export functionality issue <a id="import-export-error" />

First, use the browser developer tools to check if the response body during the import/export process contains references to `univer-minio`. If it does, the issue might be due to improper S3 configuration, leading to import/export functionality issues. Follow the steps below to verify and correctly configure your S3 settings.

Assuming you are using the pre-installed Minio service, open the `.env` file and modify the `S3_ENDPOINT_PUBLIC` configuration item according to the instructions below, replacing it with the public or private network IP where the Docker service is running.

```diff
- S3_ENDPOINT_PUBLIC=http://univer-minio:9000
+ S3_ENDPOINT_PUBLIC=http://<Public_or_Private_IP_of_Docker_Service>:19000
```

After making the changes, restart the service to verify the configuration.

**Note:** Do not set this to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, as this will prevent the frontend from accessing the S3 service.

If you are using your own S3 service, you can refer to the complete [S3 configuration](#s3-config).

In addition to S3 configuration issues, you should also check whether [the import/export API configuration](/guides/sheet/features/import-export#configuration) of the Univer Server in the frontend project is correct.

If you even have some problem, can use `docker compose logs univer-worker-exchange --since 30m` to get log and ask help in community.

### How to find error when server start failed?

You can use `docker compose logs` to see server logs, for example:

```shell
# see universer latest 20 minute logs
docker compose logs -f universer --since 20m
```

### How to restart, stop, uninstall server?

```shell
# restart server
bash run.sh

# stop server
docker compose stop

# uninstall
docker compose down

# uninstall and clean data
docker compose down --volumes
```

### How to change host port the server used?

You can update the `.env` file, then run `bash run.sh`

```
# host ports
HOST_NGINX_PORT=8000
HOST_MINIO_PORT=19000
HOST_GRAFANA_PORT=13000
```

### How to change database to MySQL?

1. Required MySQL >= 8.0

2. Update `.env` file, set the MySQL config and delete PostgreSQL config.

<Image src={mysqlImg} alt="mysql" width={500} />

3. The `docker-compose.mysql.yaml` apply a MySQL component, if you want to use yourself database, you can delete the `univer-mysql` service in `docker-compose.mysql.yaml` file, and delete the dependencies in other service `depends_on` properties.

4. Start/Restart the service: `bash run.sh`

### How to change S3 config?  <a id="s3-config"></a>

1. Update `.env` file, set the S3 config.
```shell
# s3 config
S3_USER=minio
S3_PASSWORD=minio123456
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_PATH_STYLE=true
S3_ENDPOINT=http://univer-minio:9000
S3_ENDPOINT_PUBLIC=http://univer-minio:9000
S3_DEFAULT_BUCKET=univer
```

- `S3_PATH_STYLE`: `true` bucket is in path info; `false` bucket is in domain info.
- `S3_REGION`: the bucket region, like aws `us-east-1`.
- `S3_ENDPOINT`: internal network endpoint.
- `S3_ENDPOINT_PUBLIC`: public network endpoint, use to download file.
- `S3_DEFAULT_BUCKET`: s3 bucket, create it before start univer service.

2. Start/Restart the service: `bash run.sh`

### Accessing Port 8000 Returns `404 page not found`

Port 8000 is the API port exposed by the Univer Server. Accessing `/` and receiving a `404 page not found` response is expected because there is no API at that path.

If you want to verify whether the service and functionality are working correctly, you can do so by setting up a [start-kit template frontend project](/guides/sheet/getting-started/quickstart#install-and-run-the-frontend).

### How to enable CORS ?

Update `configs/config.yaml.template` file set http config, then restart service:
```yaml
server:
  http:
    ...
    corsAllowOrigins:
    - "*"
```

`corsAllowOrigins` is a string array, support:

- "*": allow all domain CORS, but not support credential headers like authorization, cookie.
- [SelfDomainOrigin]: like http://localhost:3010, use domain origin support credential headers.
