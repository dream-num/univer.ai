# Univer Server Integration Protocol

## Introduction to USIP

USIP: Univer Server Integration Protocol

Glossary

- USIP Client: The end that initiates USIP requests, generally is the Univer Server
- USIP Server: The end that implements USIP and provides services

USIP refers to the protocol that must be followed when integrating a third-party system with Univer Server, specifically requiring implementation of a series of USIP-defined interfaces.

Based on these protocols, Univer Server can access third-party systems to obtain the results required by clients.

In this way, while ensuring that data remains within the third-party client system, Univer Server can successfully integrate into the yourself system.

## Prerequisites

1. The integrating party needs to maintain the relationship between users and documents on their own. Univer Server acts as the client to obtain user permissions under documents through an interface.
2. Implementation: Upon successfully creating a document by calling Univer Server, it returns a `unitID` as document ID. The integrating party needs to store this ID to manage their own document management operations effectively. This API in [it](/guides/sheet/server/api).

## Required Interfaces

> <p style={{ color:"red" }}>!!! Important</p>
> 1. Only the `Credential verify` api will forward credential headers information for authenticating external browser web calls; another apis are used for internal business purposes and will not be forwarded. <br />
> 2. `userID` should be of string type. <br />
> 3. Be sure USIP server network is work, and can be called by univer server. <br />
> 4. If you have some trouble when verify yourself usip server, you can add some logs in USIP server, check the univer server logs and compare your code to this document api define (like response struct is error or response value type is error). <br />

1. Credential verify: Verify user identity legality (AuthN)

- The Univer Server interface verifies user identity by forwarding all request HTTP headers to the USIP server's credential verify interface for authentication.
- If the credential verify interface validates successfully, it needs to return `User` structured data, including the user's unique identifier `userID`, which will be used in subsequent Univer Server operations.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  -H "authorization: xx" \
  -H "cookie: xx" \
  -H "YOUR-CUSTOM-HEADER: xx" \
  "http://localhost:8080/credential"
    
# response
{
  "user": {
    "userID": "xxx",
    "name": "xxx",
    "avatar": "xxx",
  }
}
```

2. Bulk User Info Retrieval

- The Bulk User Info Retrieval interface accepts a `userIDs` string array parameter where each element represents a user identifier `userID`.
- The interface returns an array of `User` objects.
- The `userIDs` array max size is 100.
- After 0.2.9 version (not include 0.2.9) this api of `GET` method will be deprecated.

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/userinfo" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"userIDs":["1","2"]}'

# response
{
  "users": [
    {"userID": "1", "name":"xxx", "avatar":"https://xxxx"},
    {"userID": "2", "name":"xxx", "avatar":"https://xxxx"},
  ]
}
```

3. Permission role: Retrieving Specific User Permissions for Specific Documents (AuthZ)

- The USIP server is responsible for managing user permissions on documents. Currently, Univer Server has predefined several roles:

| Role   | Description       |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| owner  | Manages the document |
| editor | Can edit the document |
| reader | Can view the document |

- The Permission role interface accepts a `unitID` parameter identifying the document ID and a `userID` parameter identifying the user.

```shell
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/role?unitID=xxx&userID=xxx"

# response
{
  "userID": "xxx",
  "role": "owner"
}
```

4. Get Collaborator List: Retrieve the list of collaborators for a document

- The Get Collaborator List interface should accept a `unitIDs` string array parameter, allowing retrieval of collaborator lists for multiple documents simultaneously.
- The `unitIDs` array max size is 100.
- After 0.2.9 version (not include 0.2.9) this api of `GET` method will be deprecated.

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/collaborators" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"unitIDs":["AA","BB"]}'

# response
{
  "collaborators": [
    {
      "unitID":"AA",
      "subjects":[
        {
          "subject": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "xx",
            "avatar": "xxx",
            "type": "user"
          },
          "role":"owner"
        },
        {
          "subject": {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "xx",
            "avatar": "xxx",
            "type": "user"
          },
          "role":"editor"
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

## Univer Server Service Configuration

To enable USIP functionality, configure the above interface addresses in the `.env` file located in the docker-compose directory, and then restart the service.

```shell
# usip about
USIP_ENBALED=true
USIP_URI_CREDENTIAL=http://localhost:8080/credential
USIP_URI_USERINFO=http://localhost:8080/userinfo
USIP_URI_ROLE=http://localhost:8080/role
USIP_URI_COLLABORATORS=http://localhost:8080/collaborators
```

### Troubleshooting <a id="troubleshooting" />

1. If you want to make unit can be edit/read to everyone in default, you can set this in `.env`:
```shell
AUTH_PERMISSION_ENABLED=true
AUTH_PERMISSION_DEFAULT_SHARE_SCOPE=public
AUTH_PERMISSION_DEFAULT_SHARE_ROLE=editor
```
- AUTH_PERMISSION_DEFAULT_SHARE_ROLE: support setting is `editor`, `reader`.

2. `AUTH_PERMISSION_ENABLE_OBJ_INHERIT` control if file owner can have all permission, `true` or `false`.
