# Deploying to Kubernetes

<BadgeGroup values={[UniverTypes.GENERAL]} value={UniverTypes.GENERAL} />

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source platform for orchestrating containerized applications, automating their deployment, scaling, and management. In this guide, we'll leverage Helm, Kubernetes' package manager, to streamline our deployment process.

## Technical Overview

Deploying Univer backend services on Kubernetes involves several key components:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: The environment where your app resides.
- **Helm**: The deployment and management tool for apps on Kubernetes. Require Helm 3.
- **Database and Messaging**: PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ services.

## Installing Helm

Head over to the [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to get started.
Once installed, confirm Helm's presence by executing:

```bash
helm version
```

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>
  ### Kubernetes Cluster Setup

  Make sure you have an active Kubernetes cluster. For cloud providers like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), adhere to their specific instructions for cluster creation.

  ### Deploying Univer services

  1. Use Helm to deploy Univer services:

  ```bash
  helm install univer --create-namespace \
      --set global.istioNamespace=univer \
      oci://univer-acr-registry.cn-shenzhen.cr.aliyuncs.com/helm-charts/univer-stack

  kubectl rollout restart deployment/collaboration-server -n univer
  kubectl rollout restart deployment/universer -n univer
  ```

  2. To check if your deployment is up and running:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

  ### Deployment Verification

  ```bash
  # For quick testing, you might edit your local hosts file to map the domain.
  # Default domain: univer.example.com

  Visit: http://univer.example.com
  ```
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If your service isn't launching, verify the status of your Kubernetes Pods and consult the logs for clues.

### Can not download oci ?

The `helm` require version >= 3, if version is less than 3.8, it should set enviroment `export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
` to open OCI feature. See [helm document](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/).
