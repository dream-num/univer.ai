## Univer OSS & Business Upgrade Subscription

Univer has open-sourced most of its core functionalities and provides corresponding npm packages. Any organization or individual can use these features for free, which we refer to as Univer OSS (Open Source Software).

Additionally, for some advanced features aimed at enterprises and organizations (such as collaborative editing, live sharing, import & export, printing, etc.), we offer corresponding npm packages and backend services. These features are closed-source but are also available for free commercial use.

For enterprises with higher demands, Univer offers business upgrade subscriptions. This service provides more advanced features and support for users with special requirements.

## Environment Support

Univer's compilation target is Chrome 70, but this does not mean that Univer can fully support all browsers. We will do our best to ensure that Univer runs smoothly in the following browsers:
