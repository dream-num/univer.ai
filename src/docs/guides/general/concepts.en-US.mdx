# Basic Concepts

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧱">
  Before diving deeper into Univer, please read this document to understand the basic concepts of Univer, which will help you use Univer more smoothly.
</Callout>

The basic concepts include:

* Plugin
* Snapshot
* Command
* Facade API
* Presets

## Plugins

All of Univer's features are provided by plugins, which are the basic building blocks of Univer. Multiple plugins combined together form a Univer application.

The responsibilities of plugins include:

1. Implementing features, such as `@univerjs/sheets-filter` provides filtering functionality.
2. Providing some basic capabilities, such as `@univerjs/engine-render` provides rendering capabilities.

You can combine Univer's plugins to customize a Univer application that meets your requirements and avoid loading unnecessary code. You can also extend Univer's functionality by writing plugins to meet personalized needs.

## Snapshot

You need to load a snapshot in Univer to load a document. Each type of document provides its own snapshot format. Please refer to the above API documentation to learn how to write a snapshot that meets the format requirements:

1. The complete snapshot structure of the document can be found in the API manual [`IDocumentData`](/typedoc/@univerjs/core/interfaces/IDocumentData).
1. The complete snapshot format of the spreadsheet can be found in the API manual [`IWorkbookData`](/typedoc/@univerjs/core/interfaces/IWorkbookData).
    1. [Configure Workbook Data](/guides/sheet/getting-started/workbook-data) introduces the basic structure of the workbook.
    1. [Configure Cell Data](/guides/sheet/getting-started/cell-data) introduces the data structure of the cell.
1. You may need to save custom data in the snapshot, see [Plugin Custom Model](/guides/sheet/advanced/custom-model).

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
  Note! Univer's snapshot is only used to store data. It does not reflect the latest document status at runtime! If you want to save the document status as a snapshot, use the method to save the snapshot on the Facade API.
</Callout>

## Command

In Univer, all data modifications need to be executed through commands. The command-based approach can better track changes in values, implement functions such as undo, redo, and collaborative editing, handle complex associated logic between functions, etc.

If you want to modify document data through commands, please refer to [How to Find Command ID](/guides/sheet/tutorials/find-the-command-id).

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  **Do not modify the snapshot directly!** This will not take effect and will not trigger the update of views or UI. Please modify data through commands or the Facade API.
</Callout>

## Facade API

Facade API is a wrapper for the underlying interfaces provided by plugins, allowing developers to use Univer more easily without having to understand its internal design.

Of course, everything has two sides. Although the Facade API makes Univer easier to use, it also prevents you from accessing some more powerful APIs internally. If you need more advanced custom capabilities, you need to use the underlying API based on an understanding of the architecture.

## Presets

We have prepared some out-of-the-box solutions for users who are new to Univer. If your use case is more common, you can start with Presets. The code for Presets is also open source, so you can refer to the source code of Presets to learn how to further customize Univer.
