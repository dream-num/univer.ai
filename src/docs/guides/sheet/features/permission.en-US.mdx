# Permission

<BadgeGroup values={[UniverTypes.SHEET]} value={UniverTypes.SHEET} />

Handle permission interception in front-end scenarios. When it detects that there is no corresponding permission for a certain action, it will terminate the code execution and prompt the user about the missing permission.

## How to use

For example:

Driven by Command Mode

Execute the corresponding permission settings through the command mode. Please refer to the [Permission Setting Demo](/playground?title=Permission%20Control) for the code implementation of the worksheet permission settings.

If you want to set area protection, just modify the driven command and the corresponding parameters. For specific content, please refer to the [code](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/6e2ef32809fbb56397dd6c4d7d7fbd0ed7698e39/packages/sheets/src/commands/commands/add-range-protection.command.ts)

### Worksheet permission code example

```typescript
const commandService = accessor.get(ICommandService);
const target = getSheetCommandTarget(univerInstanceService);
if (!target) {
  return;
}
const { unitId, subUnitId } = target;
commandService.executeCommand(AddWorksheetProtectionMutation.id, {
  unitId,
  subUnitId,
  rule: {
    permissionId: "2sxcza1",
    name: "sheet",
    unitType: 2,
    unitId,
    subUnitId,
  },
});
```

This demo is to add protection to the worksheet. `permissionId` is a randomly generated unique ID for storing permissions. You need to generate it yourself. `unitType` is the type of the worksheet. You can use the `UnitObject` enumeration in the warehouse to replace the magic number above. `unitId` is the id of the workbook, and `subUnitId` is the id of the worksheet.

To delete, you can use `DeleteWorksheetProtectionMutation`, the parameters are `unitId` and `subUnitId`.

```typescript
DeleteWorksheetProtectionMutationParams {
  unitId: string;
  subUnitId: string;
}
```

### Custom selection permission code example

```typescript
const commandService = accessor.get(ICommandService);
const selectionManagerService = accessor.get(selectionManagerService);
const target = getSheetCommandTarget(univerInstanceService);
if (!target) {
  return;
}
const { unitId, subUnitId } = target;
const ranges = selectionManagerService..getSelections().map(selection => selection.range);
commandService.executeCommand(AddRangeProtectionMutation.id, {
  unitId,
  subUnitId,
  rules: [{
    permissionId: "3xtfxG1",
    name: "sheet1",
    unitType: 3,
    unitId,
    subUnitId,
    ranges,
  }],
});
```

This demo adds protection to a selected area. The parameters here are the same as above, except that there is an additional `ranges` parameter, which is the area you selected.

To delete, you can use `DeleteRangeProtectionMutation`, the parameters are `unitId` and `subUnitId` and the `ruleIds` you want to delete in batches.

```typescript
DeleteRangeProtectionMutationParams {
  unitId: string;
  subUnitId: string;
  ruleIds: string[];
}
```

### workbook permission

Currently, the overall permissions of a workbook are not set through `mutation`. Instead, the permissions are modified directly through the API. Therefore, we provide a [Facade API](/guides/sheet/facade/facade). You can set the edit permissions of a workbook by calling this API.

```typescript
import { FUniver } from "@univerjs/facade";

const univerAPI = FUniver.newAPI(univer);
```

Then you can use Univer by calling the `univerAPI` method and set the entire workbook to be uneditable:

```typescript
univerAPI.setWorkbookEditable(false);
```

The essence is to control the switch of permissions by setting the value of the permission point. The command corresponding to the permission point will read the value of the point before execution. If the permission value is false, the execution of the command will be terminated.

## Extended usage

Here we take `WorkbookEditablePermission` as an example and add permission verification in your own plug-in. Other points are similar.

```typescript
import { WorkbookEditablePermission } from '@univerjs/sheets';
import { IPermissionService } from '@univerjs/core';

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {

  }

  setWorkbookNotEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, false);
  }

  setWorkbookEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, true);
  }
}
```

You can also extend and modify other permission points to achieve permission control for different functions. For a specific list of points, please refer to the bottom of the article.

### How to extend the permission point

```typescript
import { IPermissionService, IPermissionPoint } from '@univerjs/core';

export class CustomPermissionPoint implements IPermissionPoint {
  type = UnitObject.Unkonwn; // your type
  subType = UnitAction.View; // your subType
  status = PermissionStatus.INIT;
  value = true; // Initial values
  id: string;
  constructor(unitId: string, subUnitId: string, customId: string) {
    // The id attribute needs to be guaranteed to be unique throughout `IPermissionService`.
    this.id = `${unitId}.${subUnitId}.${customId}`;
  }
}

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
    this._init()
  }

  _init() {
    this._permissionService.addPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id'));
  }
}

// How to use it elsewhere
class ConsumeService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
  }

  doSomething() {
   const point = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
   console.log(point.value);
  }

  bindEvent() {
    // This will get an RX object, allowing you to listen for changes to the current permissions and make a list of changes
    const pount$ = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint$(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
    console.log(pount$);
  }
}
```

### Integration of Third-Party Authorization Service

The logic for determining permissions is typically handled by an external service, which involves a communication process. In the frontend SDK implementation, we use the [AuthzIoLocalService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/authz-io-local.service.ts) to handle this logic.

In a production environment, we need to replace this implementation with a backend service. The frontend needs to implement the corresponding request functions based on the [IAuthzIoService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/type.ts) interface for runtime replacement.

Here's how you can replace it:

```typescript
import { IAuthzIoService, Univer } from '@univerjs/core';
import { Injector } from '@wendellhu/redi';

class YourAuthzService implements IAuthzIoService { }

export class YourPlugin extends Plugin {
  override onStarting(injector: Injector): void {
    injector.add([IAuthzIoService, { useClass: YourAuthzService }]);
  }
}

// By setting the override option to [[IAuthzIoService, null]], you can instruct Univer not to register the built-in IAuthzIoService.
// This way, Univer will use the service provided by YourAuthzService as the implementation of the authorization service.
const univer = new Univer({
  override: [[IAuthzIoService, null]],
});

univer.registerPlugin(YourPlugin);
```
