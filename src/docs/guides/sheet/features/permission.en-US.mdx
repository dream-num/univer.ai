# Permission

<BadgeGroup values={[UniverTypes.SHEET]} value={UniverTypes.SHEET} />

Handle permission interception in front-end scenarios. When it detects that there is no corresponding permission for a certain action, it will terminate the code execution and prompt the user about the missing permission.

## How to use

For example:

1. Driven by Command Mode

Execute the corresponding permission settings through the command mode. Please refer to the [Permission Setting Demo](/playground?title=Permission%20Control) for the code implementation of the worksheet permission settings.

If you want to set area protection, just modify the driven command and the corresponding parameters. For specific content, please refer to the [code](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/6e2ef32809fbb56397dd6c4d7d7fbd0ed7698e39/packages/sheets/src/commands/commands/add-range-protection.command.ts)

2. Calling via facadeAPI

On the facade instance, we expose an API that can adjust the workbook editing permissions. You can set the workbook's editing permissions by calling this API.

```typescript
import { FUniver } from "@univerjs/facade";

const univerAPI = FUniver.newAPI(univer);
```
Then you can use Univer by calling methods of univerAPI, such as setting the entire workbook to be non-editable:

```typescript
univerAPI.setWorkbookEditable(false);
```
Essentially, it controls the permission switch by setting the value of the permission point. The command corresponding to the permission point will read the value of the point before execution. If the permission value is false, the command execution will be terminated.

3. Extended Use

Here is an example of `WorkbookEditablePermission`. You can add permission verification in** **your own plugin, and other points are similar.

```typescript
import { WorkbookEditablePermission } from '@univerjs/sheets';
import { IPermissionService } from '@univerjs/core';

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {

  }

  setWorkbookNotEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, false);
  }

  setWorkbookEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, true);
  }
}
```

You can also extend and modify other permission points to achieve permission control for different functions. For a specific list of points, please refer to the bottom of the article.

### How to extend the permission point

```typescript
import { IPermissionService, IPermissionPoint } from '@univerjs/core';

export class CustomPermissionPoint implements IPermissionPoint {
  type = UnitObject.Unkonwn; // your type
  subType = UnitAction.View; // your subType
  status = PermissionStatus.INIT;
  value = true; // Initial values
  id: string;
  constructor(unitId: string, subUnitId: string, customId: string) {
    // The id attribute needs to be guaranteed to be unique throughout `IPermissionService`.
    this.id = `${unitId}.${subUnitId}.${customId}`;
  }
}

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
    this._init()
  }

  _init() {
    this._permissionService.addPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id'));
  }
}

// How to use it elsewhere
class ConsumeService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
  }

  doSomething() {
   const point = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
   console.log(point.value);
  }

  bindEvent() {
    // This will get an RX object, allowing you to listen for changes to the current permissions and make a list of changes
    const pount$ = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint$(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
    console.log(pount$);
  }
}
```

### Integration of Third-Party Authorization Service

The logic for determining permissions is typically handled by an external service, which involves a communication process. In the frontend SDK implementation, we use the [AuthzIoLocalService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/authz-io-local.service.ts) to handle this logic.

In a production environment, we need to replace this implementation with a backend service. The frontend needs to implement the corresponding request functions based on the [IAuthzIoService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/type.ts) interface for runtime replacement.

Here's how you can replace it:

```typescript
import { IAuthzIoService, Univer } from '@univerjs/core';
import { Injector } from '@wendellhu/redi';

class YourAuthzService implements IAuthzIoService { }

export class YourPlugin extends Plugin {
  override onStarting(injector: Injector): void {
    injector.add([IAuthzIoService, { useClass: YourAuthzService }]);
  }
}

// By setting the override option to [[IAuthzIoService, null]], you can instruct Univer not to register the built-in IAuthzIoService.
// This way, Univer will use the service provided by YourAuthzService as the implementation of the authorization service.
const univer = new Univer({
  override: [[IAuthzIoService, null]],
});

univer.registerPlugin(YourPlugin);
```

To access the specific code related to permission point at the given URL, you can refer to the [code](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/tree/dev/packages/sheets/src/services/permission/permission-point).

In the case where the permission control of the workbook intersects with the worksheet/range, all permissions must be set to true in order to use them.
