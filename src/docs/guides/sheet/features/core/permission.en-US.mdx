Univer provides the ability to control permissions, which can typically be used to restrict users' operations on workbooks, worksheets, and selections. When a user performs an operation without permission, the code execution can be terminated and the user can be prompted for missing permissions. For example, you can set protection in a selected area to determine whether other collaborators can use editing, reading, copying, filtering, and more within that protected area.

## Basic example

### workbook permission

Currently, the overall permissions of a workbook are modified directly through the API. We provide the [Facade API](/guides/sheet/facade/facade). You can set the edit permissions of a workbook by calling this API.

```typescript
import { FUniver } from "@univerjs/facade";

const univerAPI = FUniver.newAPI(univer);
```

Then you can use Univer by calling the `univerAPI` method and set the entire workbook to be uneditable:

```typescript
univerAPI.getActiveWorkbook().setEditable(false);
```

The essence is to control the switch of permissions by setting the value of the permission point. The command corresponding to the permission point will read the value of the point before execution. If the permission value is false, the execution of the command will be terminated.

### Worksheet permission code example

The permissions for worksheets and selections are set in command mode.

```typescript
const accessor = univer.__getInjector();
const commandService = accessor.get(ICommandService);
// import { getSheetCommandTarget } from '@univerjs/sheets';
if (!target) {
  return;
}
const { unitId, subUnitId } = target;
commandService.executeCommand(AddWorksheetProtectionMutation.id, {
  unitId,
  subUnitId,
  rule: {
    permissionId: "2sxcza1",
    name: "sheet",
    unitType: 2,
    unitId,
    subUnitId,
  },
});
```

This demo is to add protection to the worksheet. `permissionId` is a randomly generated unique ID for storing permissions. You need to generate it yourself. `unitType` is the type of the worksheet. You can use the `UnitObject` enumeration in the warehouse to replace the magic number above. `unitId` is the id of the workbook, and `subUnitId` is the id of the worksheet.

To delete, you can use `DeleteWorksheetProtectionMutation`, the parameters are `unitId` and `subUnitId`.

```typescript
DeleteWorksheetProtectionMutationParams {
  unitId: string;
  subUnitId: string;
}
```

### Custom selection permission code example

```typescript
const accessor = univer.__getInjector();
const commandService = accessor.get(ICommandService);
const sheetSelectionManagerService = accessor.get(SheetsSelectionsService);
// import { getSheetCommandTarget } from '@univerjs/sheets';
const target = getSheetCommandTarget(univerInstanceService);
if (!target) {
  return;
}
const { unitId, subUnitId } = target;
const ranges = sheetSelectionManagerService.getCurrentSelections().map(selection => selection.range);
commandService.executeCommand(AddRangeProtectionMutation.id, {
  unitId,
  subUnitId,
  rules: [{
    permissionId: "3xtfxG1",
    name: "sheet1",
    unitType: 3,
    unitId,
    subUnitId,
    ranges,
    id: 'rule1'
  }],
});
```

This demo adds permission protection to a custom selection. The parameters here are the same as above, with the addition of a `ranges` parameter, which is the area you selected, and an `id` parameter, which is the unique id used to identify this rule and is used to delete this rule.

In typical workflows, the creator of a permissioned area will have the highest level of access, which means they can always edit the area they created. To implement a scenario where no one, including the creator, can edit the area, you can add the following code to the demo provided above.

```typescript
const permissionService = accessor.get(IPermissionService);
// The third parameter of RangeProtectionPermissionEditPoint is the permissionId generated above. Setting it to false indicates that editing is not allowed.
permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new RangeProtectionPermissionEditPoint(unitId, subUnitId, "3xtfxG1").id, false);
```

To delete, you can use `DeleteRangeProtectionMutation`, the parameters are `unitId` and `subUnitId` and the `ruleIds` you want to delete in batches.

```typescript
DeleteRangeProtectionMutationParams {
  unitId: string;
  subUnitId: string;
  ruleIds: string[];
}
```

## Extended usage

Here we take `WorkbookEditablePermission` as an example and add permission verification in your own plug-in. Other points are similar.

```typescript
import { WorkbookEditablePermission } from '@univerjs/sheets';
import { IPermissionService } from '@univerjs/core';

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {

  }

  setWorkbookNotEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, false);
  }

  setWorkbookEditable() {
    this._permissionService.updatePermissionPoint(new WorkbookEditablePermission('unitId').id, true);
  }
}
```

You can also extend and modify other permission points to achieve permission control for different functions. For a specific list of points, please refer to the bottom of the article.

### How to extend the permission point

```typescript
import { IPermissionService, IPermissionPoint } from '@univerjs/core';

export class CustomPermissionPoint implements IPermissionPoint {
  type = UnitObject.Unkonwn; // your type
  subType = UnitAction.View; // your subType
  status = PermissionStatus.INIT;
  value = true; // Initial values
  id: string;
  constructor(unitId: string, subUnitId: string, customId: string) {
    // The id attribute needs to be guaranteed to be unique throughout `IPermissionService`.
    this.id = `${unitId}.${subUnitId}.${customId}`;
  }
}

class YourService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
    this._init()
  }

  _init() {
    this._permissionService.addPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id'));
  }
}

// How to use it elsewhere
class ConsumeService {
  constructor(@IPermissionService private _permissionService: IPermissionService) {
  }

  doSomething() {
   const point = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
   console.log(point.value);
  }

  bindEvent() {
    // This will get an RX object, allowing you to listen for changes to the current permissions and make a list of changes
    const pount$ = this._permissionService.getPermissionPoint$(new CustomPermissionPoint('unitId','subUnitId','my-id').id);
    console.log(pount$);
  }
}
```

### Integration of Third-Party Authorization Service

The logic for determining permissions is typically handled by an external service, which involves a communication process. In the frontend SDK implementation, we use the [AuthzIoLocalService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/authz-io-local.service.ts) to handle this logic.

In a production environment, we need to replace this implementation with a backend service. The frontend needs to implement the corresponding request functions based on the [IAuthzIoService](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/blob/dev/packages/core/src/services/authz-io/type.ts) interface for runtime replacement.

Here's how you can replace it:

```typescript
import { IAuthzIoService, Injector, Univer } from '@univerjs/core';

class YourAuthzService implements IAuthzIoService { }

export class YourPlugin extends Plugin {
  override onStarting(injector: Injector): void {
    injector.add([IAuthzIoService, { useClass: YourAuthzService }]);
  }
}

// By setting the override option to [[IAuthzIoService, null]], you can instruct Univer not to register the built-in IAuthzIoService.
// This way, Univer will use the service provided by YourAuthzService as the implementation of the authorization service.
const univer = new Univer({
  override: [[IAuthzIoService, null]],
});

univer.registerPlugin(YourPlugin);
```

## List of permission point bits
