  ```shell
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://release-univer.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/release-demo/install.sh)"
  ```

  ### Install and Run the Frontend

  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm dlx degit dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit [your-app-name]
      cd [your-app-name] && pnpm install # pnpm version >= 8
      pnpm dev
