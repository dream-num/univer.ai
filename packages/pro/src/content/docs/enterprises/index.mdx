title: Univer Pro Introduction
---

Univer Pro is a plug-and-play solution designed for a series of complex business needs. It adopts the interfaces, components, and event mechanisms publicly available in the Univer open-source version and carefully encapsulates them.

Before you learn more about Univer Pro, we hope you understand:

The difference between Univer Pro and the Univer open-source version is that Univer Pro focuses on solving complex business needs, while the Univer open-source version focuses on providing basic functions.

If your business scenario is relatively simple, or Univer Pro cannot meet your special business needs, you can try to use the Univer open-source version with our [extension documentation](/guides/customization) to customize and develop the capabilities you need.

For this reason, we provide the [Community Edition](/pro/enterprises/community-edition) of Univer Pro for you to experience for free.

If Univer Pro happens to meet your needs, you can contact our team to get the official version of Univer Pro.

## üéÆ Online Demo

Just like the Univer open-source version, we also provide an online demo for Univer Pro. You can [üéÆ click here](/pro-examples/) to view the online demo of Univer Pro.
