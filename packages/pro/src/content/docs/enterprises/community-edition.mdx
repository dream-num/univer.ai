## Deployment

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="docker-compose">
    Environment: Linux、Mac、Windows/WSL.

    1. Clone this repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dream-num/helm-charts.git
    ```

    or download from [this](https://release-univer.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/release-demo/docker-compose.zip).

    2. Navigate to the docker-compose directory and extract.

    ```bash
    cd helm-charts/docker-compose
    ```

    3. Start the backend service.

    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    ```

    4. Start the frontend demo.

    ```bash
    docker run --net=unvier-prod --rm --name univer-collaboration-lite \
      -p 3010:3010 univer-acr-registry.cn-shenzhen.cr.aliyuncs.com/release/univer-collaboration-lite:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="windows-lite">
    1. Download the [Windows 10/11 x64 version](https://release-univer.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/lite/windows.zip).

    2. Run the `start_apps.bat` file in the extracted directory, ensuring that the firewall allows the program to run during the process.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="linux-lite">
    1. Download the [linux x64 version](https://release-univer.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/lite/linux.zip).

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./start_apps.sh && ./start_apps.sh
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="mac-lite">
    1. Download the [Apple silicon version](https://release-univer.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/lite/mac.zip).

    2. In the extracted directory, execute the command.
    Note: mac requires the setting to allow non-App Store applications to run in Settings and Privacy,[see the common questions](#Troubleshooting)。
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./start_apps.sh && ./start_apps.sh
    ```
  </TabItem>

## Usage

Open a browser and enter http://localhost:3010 to automatically create a blank document and jump to the new document link (not supported in IE browsers).

### Collaborative Experience

Try accessing in different types of browsers or in private mode to fully experience the collaboration function.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. How to share to the local network for collaboration

Replace localhost with the local IP and share it with other intranet colleagues.

```bash
# Example http://localhost:3010/?unit=17443300120626831361&type=2
# http://192.168.50.172:3010/?unit=17443300120626831361&type=2
```

### 2. Mac fails to run the file

Open the system settings and set the Privacy & Security > Security > click Still Allow

![Allow Access](./imgs/mac2.png)

### 3. Internal network access fails

Check if the firewall is enabled, if enabled, ensure that the Univer port of the local area network can be accessed.

### 4. Service start fails

Check if the port is occupied, if occupied, end other processes and try starting again.
