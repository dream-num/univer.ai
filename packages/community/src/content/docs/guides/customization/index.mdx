Univer's built-in functionalities may not meet your specific needs, but you can extend Univer to implement your business logic. You can extend Univer in the following areas:

* [Command System](/guides/customization/command): This includes custom commands, supplementing mutations with other commands, and extending features like copy-paste and fill-down.
* [Formula System](/guides/customization/formula): This involves implementing custom formulas.
{/* * UI: This includes custom menus, toolbars, dialogues, and more. */}

We recommend encapsulating your extensions to Univer, along with your business code, within a Univer plugin.

You can learn how to write a custom plugin [here](/guides/customization/write-a-plugin).
