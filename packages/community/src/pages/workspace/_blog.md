Univer was born from a simple yet profound insight: the need for a one-stop productivity platform where data and information can flow freely, without the constraints of disjointed contexts or the hassle of switching formats. With Univer, we enable users to create any forms of page as they wish. By merging sheet, doc and slide's capabilities together, Univer empowers individuals and teams to create, organize and streamline workflows without barriers.

## All-In-One Solution

Univer has adopted cutting-edge architectural methodologies to build an all-in-one solution that combines kinds of documents, files and formats. We abstracted productivity tools into three key applications: **table, text, and canvas**. These three applications are developed on one core framework. Furthermore, by implementing a plug-in architecture, functionalities such as menus, images, shapes, charts, and comments can be reused across all three applications.

  controls
/>

<figcaption>This approach also enables data to be shared and exchanged between applications.</figcaption>

Taking the toolbar as an example, the `@univerjs/ui` plugin offers the `IMenuService` for registering menu items, as well as rendering the toolbar for desktop devices. Meanwhile, the `@univerjs/sheets-ui` and `@univerjs/docs-ui` plugins can implement the context menu items for spreadsheets and documents, respectively, and register these items with `IMenuService`. When registering menu items, plugins can determine when to show or hide certain menu items by specifying the `hidden$` property, for example, hiding all spreadsheet menu items if users are not working on a spreadsheet.

<div class="note">
  <span class="note-symbol">üí°</span>
  <p>This approach not only provides consistent user interaction across various document formats.</p>
</div>

In the design of Univer, there are many designs involving "underlying mechanisms" and "plugin extensions", such as:

- Shortcuts
- Copy & paste
- Collaborative editing
- Find & replace

and more.

## Formula Engine Linking Different Documents

The primary challenge of Univer‚Äôs formula engine is to bring formulas into various applications (table, text, and canvas), and empower associated features such as **conditional formatting, data validation, and pivot table** to be integrated into the formula system. And of course, we don‚Äôt accept any compromise in performance and stability when integrating these features.

<video
  src="https://docs-assets-us-west.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/univer.ai/workspace/blog-formula.mp4"
  controls
/>

Here we would like to give further explanation of how we bring formulas to different kinds of applications. Formulas in documents or slides would be wrapped in a special data structure named **Foreign Formula Field**. When a Foreign Formula Field gets loaded, the formula would register its dependencies to the formula engine's **Dependency** module. You can assume the Foreign Formula Field as a cell in a virtual worksheet. The advantage of this approach is that it implements formula in documents or slides just as how it was implemented in spreadsheets. Once the formula calculation is done, the operation of writing the calculation results back to the virtual worksheet would be intercepted and ultimately the results would be written to Foreign Formula Field.

> For detailed information, please check out the [Formula Engine Architecture Document](/guides/concepts-and-architecture/formula).

![](/workspace/img2.png)

Additionally, Univer‚Äôs formula engine now can run within **Web Worker**, allowing formula calculation with zero blockage for user experience. To facilitate this design, we developed the `@univerjs/rpc` plugin aiming to make cross-thread communication between the main-thread and web-worker as straightforward as communicating within the same thread. What's more, the rpc plugin makes the formula engine agnostic to the underlying message channel, so server side calculating would be easy to implement as it was for Web Worker.

## AI-Drive Automation with Command System

<div class="note">
  <span class="note-symbol">üí°</span>
  <p>Data is vital for AI applications. We strongly believe in the power of converting user behavior into data for AI training, which can lead to revolution breakthrough in the office domain.</p>
</div>

The command system opens up numerous possibilities for Univer, transforming user actions into digital user behavior. It enables functionalities like **undo/redo, collaborative editing, offline availability, live share, and server-side computing**.

</div>

**Uniscript** is our **AI-powered** script-engine. By integrating it with the command system, we‚Äôve taken steps from learning user behaviors to applying them in everyday scenarios. Uniscript opens new horizons for workflow automation. From generating tailored report templates to integrating specific data sources, Uniscript transforms tedious, repetitive tasks into automated processes.

## Compatibility with Office File Formats

Despite the vast array of SaaS productivity tools in the market, Office and Google Suite are still the most widely adopted.Therefore, our strategy focuses on maintaining compatibility with traditional formats while optimizing the user experience to boost productivity. To achieve this, we‚Äôve developed a set of **import / export** feature, which ensures maximum format compatibility.

## General Render Engine

To enhance the integration of doc, sheet, and slide for an unparalleled experience, Univer has developed a rendering engine based on canvas. As a result, Univer‚Äôs cell editor, formula editor, and document all share the same typesetting capability.

This innovation pushes us to rethink the limitation of a spreadsheet cell:

<div class="note">
  <span class="note-symbol">‚ùì</span>
  <p>Why can‚Äôt a cell also function as a document?</p>
</div>

For an illustration of how this works, please check out the example below.

/>

<figcaption>Univer's Full-screen editing feature.</figcaption>

A more complex and intriguing challenge would be:

<div class="note">
  <span class="note-symbol">‚ùì</span>
  <p>How can we enable doc, sheet and slide to nest with each other, and render on the same canvas?</p>
</div>

![](/workspace/img4.png)

We have implemented a `SceneViewer` element, which can hold a `Scene` and can also be added as a rendering element to another `Scene`, with the ability to adjust the position and width-height of the `SceneViewer`. The `Scene` can be understood as a container for a document rendering element. During canvas drawing, it will use its own layout information as a layout constraint for the Scene it holds and then draw its content. In this way, different document contents can be drawn on the same canvas.

## Collaborative Editing for All Document Types

Collaborative editing is a challenging issue. It involve **multi-replica consistency, offline availability, version management, undo & redo**, etc. In Univer, the presence of various document types makes collaborative editing even more complex. However, by reusing the collaborative mechanism for different types of documents, we cut off tons of complexity. In order to make Univer more adaptive to our users' scenarios, to resolve editing conflicts and to keep user intents in a more precise manner, we chose the [Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) collaborative solution (OT). We‚Äôve developed a `TransformService` that allows transformation algorithms to be registered. So supporting different types of documents is just writing transformation algorithms and registering them to the service.

The Univer server focuses on scalability and performance, designed to support distributed systems for greater concurrency and performance. It primarily uses two programming languages: **Golang** and **JavaScript**.

- Golang excels in handling intense concurrency and rapid network I/O, allowing the Univer collaboration engine to easily handle excessive client connection requests.
- JavaScript (Node.js) makes code sharing between the backend and the frontend an piece of cake, significantly reducing the possibility of running into errors in handling conflicts and establishing a crucial foundation for future server-side computation and rendering.

With those benchmark results, the Univer Collaboration Engine distinctly showcases outstanding performance in real-time collaboration while maintaining stability and reliability. The graph demonstrates that when handling **200 concurrent users** on a modest 4-core 8GB server, the engine manages to keep collaboration delays remarkably low at around **1.3 seconds**. We will continue to improve the engine‚Äôs ability to support a large number of concurrent users while keeping latency to a minimum.
